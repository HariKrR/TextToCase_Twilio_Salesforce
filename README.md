TextToCase Twilio Salesforce
============================

Receive, manage and respond to Text Messages as Cases in Salesforce.com

This project uses a subset of the full Twilio/SFDC Library which you can find here:
https://github.com/britishboyindc/twilio-salesforce

Although I haven't tested it, this should work with the full library as well.

Still needs a little more work to make it work out the box...but will get it finished soon.
I need to updates some test scripts after changing some code (added support for Chatter Actions)
Will then add some instructions on blog to show how to setup REST API, and configure the code once installed.

Code also needs some commentary so folks can understand the flow...
